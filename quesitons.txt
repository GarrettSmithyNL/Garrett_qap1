1.) This took me about 6 hours in total to complete. The
      part that took me the longest was definitly setting up
      the flex boxes for the layout of the page, which took
      3 hours.

2.) I only used w3schools for html and css, seeing how the basics
      work then I would just play with the element on the page.

3.) I asked my girlfriend who is a software developer about sizing
    and sytling, so it looks good. 

4.) I asked a couple of questions in class about classless css.
    Im also always questions in class.

5.) This was about a 3 or a 4 out of 5 in terms of difficulty, all
      the little pixel movement with the flex boxes. The only 
      thing that I would do differently would be to start with 
      setting up the flexboxes first then add the content, which is
      something i didnt do.
