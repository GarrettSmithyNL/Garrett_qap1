          <h3>Where do Cats Come From?</h3>
          <p class="bodyPara">
            The domestic house cat, also known as <b>FELIS CATUS</b>, came from
            a linage of large cats, such as lions and tigers. The point in the
            evolutionary track where house cats and lions split appart is around
            10-15 million years ago. This is also when a large amount of smaller
            cats diviated from the larger cats. The house cat is a part of the
            smaller cats, and is the only one that has been domesticated.

          <h3>Anatomy of Cats</h3>
          <p class="bodyPara">
            House cats have some intersting features, such as wiskers, which
            help them survive when they werent domesticated. Some of these
            aspects of house cats are:
          </p>
          <div id="catList">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Whiskers - Used to help judge the amount of space they are
                squeezing into.
              </li>
              <li>
                Large Pulipils - Where cats are nocturnal, and need to see in
                the dark.
              </li>
              <li>
                Color of Fur - Each cat has a unique color of fur, which helps
                them blend into their environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tail - Cats use their tails to help them balance, and to help
                them communicate with other cats.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Cat Habitats</h3>
          <p class="frontPara">
            House cats are found all over the world, and they live in a variety
            of habitats. Cats are incredably adaptable, historically they have
            been found in the desert, the jungle, and the tundra. Cats are also
            found in urban areas, where they are kept as pets. Cats are also
            found in the wild, where they are known as feral cats. Feral cats
            are cats that have been abandoned by their owners, and have had to
            adapt to living in the wild. Feral cats are a problem in many areas,
            as they can be a danger to local wildlife, and can spread disease.
